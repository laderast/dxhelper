# xvhelper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Note: this package was recently named `dxhelper`. It has been renamed to
`xvhelper` to reflect that it is not software that is released by
DNAnexus product.

The goal of xvhelper is to provide an tidy interface to decoding raw
values from exported Apollo datasets, whether they are exported from
`dx extract_dataset` or through a SparkSQL query.

Given the data dictionary and the codings files, it will decode the
categorical values from the raw data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of xvhelper from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("laderast/xvhelper")
```

## Note about example data

All examples are shown with synthetic data. These are not actual
patients from UKB RAP.

## Read in CSV file or SQL generated `data.frame`

`{xvhelper}` works with both the CSV files that is generated from
`dx extrqct_dataset` or the `datq.frame` that is generated from running
the Spark SQL query.

If you need to load the CSV file in, `readr::read_csv` is recommended:

``` r
cohort <- readr::read_csv("my_dataset.csv", show_col_types=FALSE)
```

## Build coding dictionary

We’ll need two `data.frame`s: a `coding_dict` and a `data_dict`. These
are `data.frame`s from the `.coding.csv` and `data_dictionary.csv` files
that are generated with the `-ddd` (dump dataset dictionary) option of
`dx extract_dataset`. We read them in using `readr::read_csv`.

``` r
coding_dict <- readr::read_csv("my_dataset.coding.csv", show_col_types=FALSE)
data_dict <- readr::read_csv("my_dataset.data_dictionary.csv" , show_col_types=FALSE)
```

Then we’ll build a coding dictionary by combining `coding_dict` and
`data_dict`.

``` r
merged_code <- merge_coding_data_dict(coding_dict, data_dict)

head(merged_code)
#> # A tibble: 6 × 9
#>   title        ent_field entity name  coding_name code  meaning is_sparse_coding

```

## Decoding Integer Categories of Apollo Datasets

Categorical data is returned by `dx extract_dataset` as the integer
representation. To see the actual values, they must be decoded from the
`codings.csv` that is generated from `dx extract_dataset`.

Data fields that have multiple categories must also be parsed and
decoded. If the data is a sparse field, it is a combined
categorical/numerical field.

## Show Raw Cohort File

Here’s a cohort that was returned by `dx extract_dataset`. Note that
there are multiple columns encoded as categories. We need to decode
these values.

``` r
knitr::kable(head(cohort[,c(1:5,14)]))
```

| participant.p21022 | participant.p100240_i0 | participant.p100240_i1 | participant.p100240_i2 | participant.p100240_i3 | participant.p31 |
|-------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|----------------:|
|                 43 |                     NA |                      1 |                      1 |                     NA |               0 |
|                 60 |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |               0 |
|                 53 |                     NA |                      0 |                      0 |                      0 |               0 |
|                 62 |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |               0 |
|                 67 |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |               0 |
|                 61 |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |                     NA |               0 |

## Decode Columns

We can decode the integer values into the actual values using
`decode_categories` and our `merged_code` object:

``` r
decoded_cohort <- cohort |>
  decode_df(merged_code)

knitr::kable(head(decoded_cohort[,c(1:5,14)]))
```

| participant.p21022 | participant.p100240_i0 | participant.p100240_i1 | participant.p100240_i2 | participant.p100240_i3 | participant.p31 |
|-------------------:|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
|                 43 | NA                     | Yes                    | Yes                    | NA                     | Female          |
|                 60 | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | Female          |
|                 53 | NA                     | No                     | No                     | No                     | Female          |
|                 62 | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | Female          |
|                 67 | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | Female          |
|                 61 | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | NA                     | Female          |

## Decode Column Names

Optionally, you can also decode the column names in the table to be
R-friendly column names with the actual field titles:

``` r
final_cohort <- decoded_cohort |>
  decode_column_names(merged_code)

knitr::kable(head(final_cohort[,c(1:5,14)]))
```

| age_at_recruitment | coffee_consumed_instance_0 | coffee_consumed_instance_1 | coffee_consumed_instance_2 | coffee_consumed_instance_3 | sex    |
|-------------------:|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------|:-------|
|                 43 | NA                         | Yes                        | Yes                        | NA                         | Female |
|                 60 | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | Female |
|                 53 | NA                         | No                         | No                         | No                         | Female |
|                 62 | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | Female |
|                 67 | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | Female |
|                 61 | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | NA                         | Female |

If you want the original field names with no modifications, you can set
the argument `r_clean_names` to `FALSE`:

``` r
final_cohort2 <- decoded_cohort |>
  decode_column_names(merged_code, r_clean_names=FALSE)

knitr::kable(head(final_cohort2[,c(1:5,14)]))
```

| Age at recruitment | Coffee consumed \| Instance 0 | Coffee consumed \| Instance 1 | Coffee consumed \| Instance 2 | Coffee consumed \| Instance 3 | Sex    |
|-------------------:|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|:-------|
|                 43 | NA                            | Yes                           | Yes                           | NA                            | Female |
|                 60 | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | Female |
|                 53 | NA                            | No                            | No                            | No                            | Female |
|                 62 | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | Female |
|                 67 | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | Female |
|                 61 | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | NA                            | Female |

## Multi-valued columns

Multivalued columns are returned as a pipe (`|`) delimited string (this
is to avoid issues with commas within categorical values):

``` r
knitr::kable(final_cohort[1:10,"diagnoses_main_icd10"])
```

| diagnoses_main_icd10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## New (7/24) Incremental Decoding of Very Large Data Frames

One thing to note is that decoding a large dataset (for UKB Pheno data,
this can be over 500K rows) takes time. The new function
`decode_multi_large_df` will split the dataset into a smaller number of
data frames, the size of which is specified by `df_size`, which is then
processed one data frame at a time, with a progress bar.

This is not necessarily faster, but it does give the user a sense of
progress.

``` r
decoded_cohort <- mydf |>
  decode_multi_large_df(merged_code, df_size = 2)
#> [1] "Processing multi columns"

knitr::kable(decoded_cohort)
```
