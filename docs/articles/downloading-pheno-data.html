<p>If we are running JupyterLab or RStudio on the RAP/DNAnexus platform,
we can use <code>xvhelper</code> to automate our downloading and
decoding of the Pheno Data.</p>

<p>We can first use <code><a href="../reference/find_all_datasets.html">find_all_datasets()</a></code> to return a
<code>data.frame</code> of all datasets available in our project.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>On UKB RAP, you’ll see that the dataset name follows the following
convention:</p>
<p><code>{application_id}_{date_dispensed}.dataset</code></p>
<p>We will use the latest dataset, which is the top row (well, there is
only one dataset in our project, but if you do multiple dispensals in
your project you will have multiple datasets). We can also find this by
using <code>find_dataset_id</code>, which will give us the last dataset
dispensed:</p>

<p>Now we have our project/dataset id, we can use it to grab metadata.
We’l first fetch the dictionaries for our particular dataset.</p>

<p>Now that we have the dictionary files into our JupyterLab/RStudio
storage, we can extract the coding/data dictionary, which we’ll use in
our decoding.</p>
